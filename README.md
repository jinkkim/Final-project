# Final Project
"Let Love Grow"
Let Love Grow is a social media platform built on the idea that quality of relationships is greater than the quantity of relationships. The app allows users to access a shared dashboard with a partner. Through the dashboard, users are able to keep in mind what's most important to their shared relationship.
